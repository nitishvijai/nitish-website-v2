# nitish-website-v2

Updated website created from scratch in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.

The version 1 repo is [here](https://github.com/nitishvijai/nitish-website-v1) for archival/legacy purposes.

Motivation:
  - To gain HTML, CSS, and other web dev. skills by creating a website from scratch
  - Simplify the current website with a design I've envisioned with CSS
  - Enhance the user experience with mobile responsive design and JavaScript animations
  - Have fun in the process!

## UPDATE 3/12/2023

This version of the site is no longer maintained. It's been a good three years, but it's time for something bigger and better to come.

Version 3.0 of the site should be up [here](https://nitishv.dev) soon! It's now React-powered and takes the best of this site to a new level! To follow all future development, the repo is [here](https://github.com/nitishvijai/nitish-website-v3) on GitHub. See you on the other side!

Over and out,<br/>
