# nitish-website-v2

Updated website created from scratch in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.

Motivation:
  - To gain HTML, CSS, and other web dev. skills by creating a website from scratch
  - Simplify the current website with a design I've envisioned with CSS
  - Enhance the user experience with mobile responsive design and JavaScript animations
  - Have fun in the process! (UPDATE 6/11/2020: I did have fun in the process!)

## UPDATE 6/11/2020

I have officially finished this new site, and I've ultimately learned a lot in these past few months. Although I knew some basic HTML and CSS prior to this project, I wanted to become more confident in my skills, and I thus believe I've attained my goals.

I've learned a lot of new concepts, such as mobile responsive design, jQuery/JavaScript interaction, and CSS animations. I've also learned a lot of lessons for my next project, including as to why mobile should NOT be an afterthought, etc (ðŸ˜‚).

I do plan to redo the website every summer, learning a new web framework/technology with each revision. With this site, though, I'm glad to say that I'm ready to take on another web development project using the skills I've gained!

Over and out,<br/>
