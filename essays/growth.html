            <p>As human beings, we expand our knowledge through education and learning. By reading this below, you are doing just that.</p>
            <br/>
            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>At some point in our life, we were all staunch haters of going to school, class, educational extracurricular activities, or work. I remember some of the many days where I dreaded going to school after a long vacation, since the transition from fun to structure often took place in a matter of a few days or even hours. It felt weird to face the fact that I wouldn’t be seeing my cousins or other relatives in India every day. All my free time playing video games then would be lost in favor of studying for tests or completing homework assignments.</p>

            <p>Most times, I’ve often put off studying for tests and quizzes in middle and high school to focus on other matters, not thinking about or realizing the negative consequences of my actions until after I opened the gradebook on Home Access Center (still thinking ‘bout the fact that each AP Bio test was a massive RIP).</p>
                
            <p>In short, I guess I could say I caught a very early bout of senioritis – although arguably, it wasn’t as bad then as it was last year after applying to college my senior year of high school. I just wasn’t motivated enough to put myself back in the educational mindset. I loved to learn, although I really wasn’t a fan of waking up at 6 in the morning every day then attending seven or eight hours of school.</p>
                
            <p>However, after diving into the field of computer science and the facets of engineering years ago, I’ve come to realize how important the drive and passion for learning really is for facilitating personal and professional growth. You may have heard of it as the “growth mindset.”</p>
