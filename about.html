            <h3 class="pgs-header">A Little About Me</h3>
            <p class="pgs-right">Howdy! My name is Nitish Vijai and I am an aspiring software engineer and sophomore from Centerville, OH, now pursuing a bachelor’s degree in computer science at the University of Michigan. By majoring in the vast field of computer science, I’m working to develop skills that can help positively shape our world’s future.</p>

            <p class="pgs-right">Over the years, I’ve learned many computer languages through taking supplemental classes at Sinclair Community College throughout high school, such as C++, Java, C#, Visual Basic, HTML, CSS, and ASP .NET. I believe that it’s not just important to “know the language,” but to also be proficient in it, so I practice programming in these languages from time to time. In addition, I have recently become adept at the Unix terminal, Python, and the crazy world of Linux distros (especially Ubuntu).
                
            <p class="pgs-right">Being in the field of computer science, I enjoy exploring new applications and projects, and I like to take on challenges with a positive attitude and growth mindset. As an engineer, I know the importance of a growth mindset. Whether it's a new language or technology, the field is always changing, and as engineers, we have the ability to adapt and overcome such challenges. I take pride in my love for learning and I firmly believe that such a mindset will take one far.
                
            <p class="pgs-right">When I'm not inside a cubicle or in class, I enjoy hanging out with friends and family, catching up on the latest in tech, writing new programs, and watching TV shows like The Office.</p>
        
            <h3 class="pgs-header">What I Am Looking For</h3>

            <p class="pgs-right">I am currently seeking a summer 2021 software engineering internship where I will either be involved in back-end development or working with database management. Please contact me with the information provided in the Contact page. I would love to hear from you!</p>
